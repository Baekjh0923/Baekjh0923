Report Of Learning AI Using YOLO V5

# SUBJECT OF LEARNING
K-POP is gaining popularity worldwide. I thought it would be a great idea to create an algorithm that helps people who want to resemble Korean idols by identifying which idol they look like and then recommending styling tips, such as hairstyles, based on the idols' styles.

I selected NewJeans, one of the most popular K-pop groups at the moment, and decided to train the model using the music video for their song "ETA."
